        <ul>
            <li>Heavy Rainfall: Intense rainfall, particularly during the northeast monsoon, overwhelms the city's
                drainage capacity.</li>
            <li>Rapid Urbanization & Concretization: The construction of concrete structures and buildings on vast
                tracts of land reduces the natural absorption of rainwater, increasing surface runoff</li>
            <li>Poor Drainage Infrastructure: Inadequate design, construction, and maintenance of drainage channels and
                systems lead to blockages by debris and a reduced capacity to handle heavy Rainfall</li>
            <li>South Chennai: Areas like Velachery, Adyar, Perumbakkam, and Pallikaranai are consistently vulnerable to
                flooding.</li>
            <li>Loss of Life and Economic Damage: Floods have caused significant loss of life and substantial economic
                losses, as seen in the 2015 floods</li>
            <li>Environmental Impact: Damage to crops, loss of topsoil, and harm to livestock are potential consequences
                for the surrounding agricultural regions</li>
